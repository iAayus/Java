# JavaBasics

This repository contains a collection of Java programs that are suitable for beginners who want to learn the language or practice their skills. The programs cover a range of topics, from basic syntax and control structures to more advanced concepts like object-oriented programming and data structures. Some of the programs are based on assignments and projects from college courses, while others are personal projects that I created to learn more about Java. Feel free to use and modify these programs as you see fit, and I hope they help you in your Java learning journey!
